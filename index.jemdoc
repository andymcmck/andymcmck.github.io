== About me

I am a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, where I was advised by [https://pdhoff.github.io/ Peter Hoff].\n
Prior to coming to Duke, I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto and had the opportunity to collaborate with [http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/reid/ Nancy Reid] there.\n

I am excited about what the future holds in store. This year I will be working with [https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/drton-mathias Mathias Drton] as a Postdoctoral researcher in Munich.\n
In the summer of 2024, I will be joining the [https://www.ualberta.ca/mathematical-and-statistical-sciences/index.html Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences] at the University of Alberta as an assistant professor.\n
