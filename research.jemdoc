== Research Interests
My work currently focuses on problems at the intersection of algebra, geometry and statistics. One particular area I am interested in is the statistical analysis of non-Euclidean data. Classical statistical techniques can usually only be partially leveraged to deal with non-Euclidean data, presenting distinct challenges. A second, related topic that I like to think about is the study of the geometry and symmetries of statistcal models. If you are interested in these areas please do not hesitate to reach out!
